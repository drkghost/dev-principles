## Conway's Law
Any organization that designs a system (defined broadly) will produce a design whose structure is a copy of the organization's communication structure.
you can't change the fundamental structure of your software without changing the fundamental structure of your team (which is often more difficult).

## Fail fast
don't handle all errors, your software should crash boldly and horribly if an error occurs.
better to crash application than allow it continue to work in case of critical exception has been thrown
